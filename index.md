## Be welcome! This blog is made by...

Kaíque P. S., self-proclaimed Computational Social Scientist. Well, actually, I am a Politologist. Ain't that bad, is it?

Casual and academic posts about Political Science, Computer Science, and Mathematics. Some posts about softwares that may be being developed. Discussions allowed!

Hope you all enjoy!

Oh! Before I forget: sometimes I may start writing in Português Brasileiro. Trying to be inclusive here, hope you'll understand.

### First post! A brief introduction to Computational Social Science

### Second post. A series about CSS Tools: On Agent Based Models!

### Walkthrough: The mathematics & computer skills to get into Formal Theory! A Personal guide.

When around the half of my undergraduation, I happened to come across with two areas that are, since this first contact, my favorites. They are
Game Theory annd Social Choice Theory. The problem is, even though the professors kept talking about how important those subjects are, they both
did not teached us the latter, nor did they give us conditions to be able to get into them. Ok, getting to the point: the aforementioned subjects
requires a lot of math, and here is a list of the subjects needed to get into GT and Theory, with a graph relating the former. The graph illustrates
a path to be followed, from the basics to GT and SCT. Some explanation on how important each mathject is and for what will also be given, together with
book recommendations.

```
The Math list: 

1. Precalculus
2. Differential & Integral Calculus
3. Probability
4. Proofs
5. Discrete Mathematics
6. Real Analysis
```

The Math graph:

Now, some bonus. They may be not directly, nor necessarily related to GT and SCT, BUT! And that is a big but, they not only can, but are being used
in GT and SCT research. Along with the math above, the computer skills below will make possible for one to learn and perform research in, mostly,
Algorithmic Game Theory and Computational Social Choice Theory. Those skills will also make much more easir for one to get into Agent-Based Modeling!

```
The Computer Science List:

1. Programming
2. Algorithms and/or Data Structures
3. Artificial Intelligence
```


### About: Political Science curriculum - How to improve

This post refers, but no exclusively, to... lets call it PSD( reads Political Science Department ), or DCP in Brazilian Portuguese.

| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
